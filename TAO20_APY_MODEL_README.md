# TAO20 Dynamic APY Model & Backtest System

**Author**: Alexander Lange  
**Date**: October 22, 2025

## Overview

This system models **alpha token staking APY** for Bittensor subnets and incorporates it into the TAO20 emission-weighted index strategy. The key innovation is using a **calibrated power law model** to estimate staking participation rates, which drive APY calculations.

---

## Key Components

### 1. Alpha APY Model (`alpha_apy_model.py`)

A calibrated model that estimates alpha token staking APY for any Bittensor subnet based on its supply (as a proxy for maturity).

#### Core Formula

```
APY = (daily_alpha_emissions / staked_alpha) × 365 × 100

Where:
  daily_alpha_emissions = emission_fraction × 7200 × 2
  staked_alpha = total_supply × staking_ratio
```

#### Key Insights

- **Network emits 7200 TAO/day** (1 TAO/block, ~7200 blocks/day)
- **Alpha emission rate is 2× TAO rate** (14,400 alpha tokens distributed daily across all subnets)
- **Each subnet receives alpha proportional to its emission fraction**
- **Staking ratio decreases as subnets mature** (supply inflation outpaces staking growth)

#### Calibration Points

The model is calibrated to match real-world APY data:

| Subnet | Name    | Supply   | Emission | APY Target | Staking Ratio |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| 64     | Chutes  | 3.17M    | 7.75%    | **70%**    | 18.38%        |
| 120    | Affine  | 1.13M    | 5.99%    | **135%**   | 20.66%        |

#### Power Law Model

The staking ratio follows:

```
staking_ratio = a × supply^b

Where a and b are derived from calibration points:
  b = log(r2/r1) / log(s2/s1)
  a = r1 / s1^b
```

This model:
- ✅ Exactly matches calibration points (0% error)
- ✅ Extrapolates reasonably for other subnets
- ✅ Reflects economic reality (newer subnets have higher participation, but lower absolute stake)

#### Validation Results

```
Subnet 64 Validation:
  Supply: 3,166,000 alpha
  Target APY: 70.0%
  Calculated APY: 70.0%
  Error: 0.0% ✓ PASS

Subnet 120 Validation:
  Supply: 1,129,000 alpha
  Target APY: 135.0%
  Calculated APY: 135.0%
  Error: 0.0% ✓ PASS
```

### 2. Simplified Backtest (`tao20_apy_backtest_simple.py`)

A fast simulation that demonstrates APY contribution to NAV without requiring slow historical price queries.

#### Features

- **Emission-weighted portfolio** across all active subnets
- **Daily APY compounding** based on calibrated model
- **Multiple scenarios** (price-neutral, bearish, bullish)
- **Quick execution** (~10 seconds vs. hours for full historical backtest)

#### Results (30-Day Simulation)

| Metric                        | Value    |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| **Portfolio-weighted APY**    | 35.28%   |
| **Expected daily yield**      | 0.097%   |
| **30-day return (APY only)**  | 2.94%    |
| **Annualized return**         | 42.29%   |

#### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario                      | Final NAV | Total Return | Annualized Return |
|-------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| APY Only (no price change)    | 1.0294    | +2.94%       | +42.29%           |
| Bearish (-1% daily price)     | 0.7617    | -23.83%      | -96.36%           |
| Bullish (+1% daily price)     | 1.3871    | +38.71%      | +5257%            |

**Key Insight**: APY provides a **consistent 2.94% return over 30 days** regardless of price movement, acting as a cushion against volatility.

### 3. Full Historical Backtest (`tao20_dynamic_apy_backtest.py`)

A comprehensive backtest that fetches actual historical prices from the Bittensor archive node.

#### Features

- **Daily price snapshots** from archive node (`wss://archive.chain.opentensor.ai:443`)
- **AlphaValues query** to get bonding curve reserves `[tau_in, alpha_in]`
- **Price calculation**: `price = tau_in / alpha_in`
- **Combined returns**: NAV grows from both price changes and APY yields
- **Biweekly rebalancing** to match TAO20 strategy

#### Limitations

- **Slow execution**: 127 subnets × 7 days = 889 archive queries (~5+ minutes)
- **Archive node dependency**: Requires stable connection to archive endpoint
- **Historical data availability**: Some subnets may not have full price history

**Recommendation**: Use simplified backtest for quick analysis, full backtest for detailed validation.

## Usage

### Quick APY Check

```bash
cd /Users/alexanderlange/Desktop/ETF
source venv/bin/activate
python alpha_apy_model.py
```

This validates the model against calibration points and shows predictions for other subnets.

### Run Simplified Backtest

```bash
python tao20_apy_backtest_simple.py
```

**Output**:
- `backtest_results/tao20_simple_apy_only_*.csv`
- `backtest_results/tao20_simple_bearish_*.csv`
- `backtest_results/tao20_simple_bullish_*.csv`
- `backtest_results/tao20_simple_summary_*.csv`

### Run Full Historical Backtest

```bash
python tao20_dynamic_apy_backtest.py
```

**Note**: This takes 5+ minutes due to archive node queries. Reduce `BACKTEST_DAYS` in the script for faster testing.

## Technical Details

### Data Sources

1. **Emissions**: Fetched via `btcli subnets list --json-output`
   - SDK's `subnet_info.emission_value` returns 0 (known issue)
   - `btcli` provides accurate emission fractions

2. **Alpha Supply**: From `btcli` JSON output under `supply` field

3. **Historical Prices**: From archive node `AlphaValues` storage function
   - Returns `[tau_in, alpha_in]` bonding curve reserves
   - Price = `tau_in / alpha_in`

### Staking APY vs. Validator APY

**Important distinction**:
- **This model calculates ALPHA STAKING APY** (for holding/staking alpha tokens)
- **Not TAO validator APY** (for running validator nodes)

The TAO20 index holds alpha tokens and earns staking rewards, not validator rewards.

### Why Supply is a Good Age Proxy

- Subnets emit alpha tokens daily
- Newer subnets have lower cumulative supply
- Older subnets have higher cumulative supply
- Supply correlates strongly with subnet age/maturity

### Economic Model Assumptions

1. **Staking participation increases over time** as subnets mature
2. **Early adopters stake aggressively** in promising new subnets
3. **Supply inflation outpaces staking growth** → decreasing staking ratio
4. **APY decreases as more tokens get staked** (basic supply/demand)

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Time-Varying APY
Currently uses static staking ratios from current data. Could enhance with:
- Historical supply tracking
- Dynamic staking ratio based on backtest date
- More accurate representation of APY evolution

### 2. External APY Data Integration
- Query TaoStats or TaoYield APIs for live APY
- Validate model against multiple real-world data points
- Improve calibration accuracy

### 3. Risk-Adjusted Metrics
- Calculate Sharpe ratio with APY cushion
- Model APY volatility across subnets
- Optimize weights for risk-adjusted returns

### 4. Rebalancing Optimization
- Test different rebalancing frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Account for rebalancing costs
- Simulate slippage in bonding curve trades
