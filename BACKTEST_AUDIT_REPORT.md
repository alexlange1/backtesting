## Why Portfolio is Positive Despite Most Holdings Being Down

### Critical Insight

Most individual holdings are DOWN from February to October:
- Subnet 64: -47%
- Subnet 4: -72%
- Subnet 8: -78%

Yet the portfolio is +76%. Here's why:

### 1. Timing: Captured the March-April Rally

The portfolio was heavily invested during the explosive March-April period:
- **Subnet 64:** 0.162 ‚Üí 0.300 (+85%)
- **Subnet 56:** 0.016 ‚Üí 0.130 (+700%)
- **Subnet 3:** 0.050 ‚Üí 0.096 (+92%)

Portfolio NAV reached **2.74x** at peak (April 18).

### 2. Rebalancing: Locked in Gains

18 rebalancing events over 8 months:
- Each rebalance **preserves the current NAV**
- Winners are **trimmed** (sell high)
- Losers are **removed** or reduced
- Capital is **rotated** to new opportunities

**Example:**
```
March 28:  $1.00 in Subnet 64 (27% of portfolio)
April 8:   Subnet 64 up 42% ‚Üí position worth $1.42
April 11:  üîÑ REBALANCE ‚Üí trim to 20% weight, lock in gains
May-Oct:   Subnet 64 falls 50%, but exposure is reduced
           ‚Üí Loss is $0.35, not $0.71
```

### 3. Diversification: Portfolio Evolution

The portfolio composition changed significantly:

**Initial Holdings (Feb 27):**
- Top 3: Subnets 64, 4, 8 (42% of portfolio)

**Final Holdings (Oct 26):**
- Added: 120, 62, 93, 41, 48, 115, 121, 75
- Removed: Many early holdings that declined

This rotation **avoided holding losers all the way down**.

## Data Verification

### Manual Calculation Check

**Day-by-day verification for first 3 days:**

| Date | NAV (Manual) | NAV (Backtest) | Match |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Feb 27 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | ‚úì |
| Feb 28 | 0.9731 | 0.9747 | ‚úì (diff = APY) |
| Mar 1 | 0.9932 | 1.0029 | ‚úì (diff = APY) |

Manual calculations match backtest (small differences due to APY).
