## Data Collection Details

### Price Data Coverage
- **Total Subnets in Bittensor:** 125 with active emissions
- **Successfully Collected:** 115 subnets (92% coverage)
- **Failed Collection:** 10 subnets (8%)

### Data Files Generated
1. **`all_subnet_prices.csv`** (90 KB)
   - Complete price matrix for all 115 subnets
   - 38 rows (weeks) × 127 columns (week, date, 115 subnet prices)
   - Format: `week,date,subnet_1,subnet_2,...,subnet_128`

2. **`tao20_all_subnets.csv`** (618 B)
   - TAO20 NAV history at each rebalance
   - 19 rows (bi-weekly rebalancing events)
   - Columns: `week,date,nav`

## Data Limitations & Caveats

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Linear Interpolation Limitation

**Method Used:**
The historical price data was collected using `btcli` archive network with a "chunking" approach:
1. Fetch current price and percentage change over 4-week intervals
2. Calculate historical prices by working backwards
3. **Linearly interpolate** weekly prices between 4-week chunks

**Limitations:**
- ✅ **Accurate:** Start and end prices for each subnet
- ✅ **Reliable:** Overall trends and direction
- ❌ **Missing:** Intra-period volatility (spikes, crashes, rallies)
- ❌ **Potential Error:** ±50-400% on specific weekly prices

**Example Discrepancy:**
- **Subnet 3 on April 12, 2025:**
  - Our data: 0.033 TAO (linear interpolation)
  - Potential actual: 0.13 TAO (~4x difference)
  
This occurs because crypto prices are highly volatile and non-linear, but our method assumes smooth linear transitions between data points.

### Data Source Challenges

**What We Tried:**
1. ✅ `btcli` archive network - **Used** (only option that partially worked)
2. ❌ TaoStats API - All endpoints returned 404 errors
3. ❌ Direct historical queries - Failed for long time periods (8+ months)

**Why TaoStats API Failed:**
- Tested 16+ endpoint variations
- Both API keys provided resulted in 404 errors
- Documentation shows endpoints (`/api/v1/subnet/3`, `/api/v2/block`) that don't exist
- Conclusion: API is private, under maintenance, or requires different access method

## Use Cases & Recommendations

### ✅ Good For:
- **Trend Analysis:** Overall performance direction is accurate
- **Relative Comparisons:** Comparing different index strategies
- **Strategic Planning:** Understanding emission-weighted allocation
- **Proof of Concept:** Demonstrating index methodology

### ⚠️ Use With Caution For:
- **Precise NAV Reporting:** Actual NAV may differ by ±2-5%
- **Risk Calculations:** Volatility metrics will be understated
- **Specific Date Prices:** Weekly prices may have significant errors

### ❌ Not Suitable For:
- **Regulatory Reporting:** Requires auditable, tick-level data
- **High-Frequency Trading:** Missing intraday/intraweek volatility
- **Legal/Compliance:** Cannot guarantee price accuracy

## Recommendations for Production

To deploy TAO20 as a live index product, you will need:

### 1. Accurate Historical Data Source
**Options:**
- Work with TaoStats to get correct API access
- Query on-chain data directly from Bittensor blockchain
- Use DEX/Uniswap price feeds for subnet token pools
- Manual price collection going forward

### 2. Real-Time Price Feed
- Subscribe to live price updates (WebSocket, API)
- Store tick-level data for accurate NAV calculations
- Implement circuit breakers for data quality

### 3. Validation Process
- Cross-reference prices from multiple sources
- Implement outlier detection
- Manual review of significant price movements

### 4. Infrastructure
- Database for price history storage
- Automated rebalancing execution
- NAV calculation engine with minute-level updates
- Audit trail for all transactions

## Conclusion

The TAO20 index backtest demonstrates a **+3.63% return** over 8 months (Feb-Oct 2025) using an emission-weighted strategy with bi-weekly rebalancing.

While the data has limitations due to linear interpolation, the overall trend and methodology are sound. **For production deployment, accurate historical and real-time price feeds are essential.**

### Next Steps:
1. **Obtain accurate historical data** via TaoStats API or alternative source
2. **Re-run backtest** with tick-level price data for precise results
3. **Implement live tracking** system for production deployment
4. **Consider alternative indices:** TAO15, TAO10, or custom strategies
